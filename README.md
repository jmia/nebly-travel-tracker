# nebly-travel-tracker
A web application built with jQuery, PHP, and Bootstrap that uses Bing Maps and MySQL to store a travel "wish list." Completed as a final project for my 4th semester [HTML5 and Front End Web Development](https://www.mohawkcollege.ca/programs/technology/computer-systems-technology-software-development-559) course (now replaced by Mobile Web Programming).
